# MCScanner
Now re-made in Java, and not Python!

## Requirements
* [`Java 17`][adopt17]
* MongoDB database (required for storing IPs)
* Stable internet connection

## Setup
### macOS + Linux + Windows
1. Download the latest `.JAR` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/StupidRepo/MCScanner/releases).
2. Run the `.JAR` file with `java -jar /path/to/MCScanner.jar` from Command Prompt or Terminal.

# Warning
### **This program was made for educational purposes only, and is not meant to be used in malicious ways**. 
Do not DDOS the IPs or do *anything* malicious with the IPs. The only thing this program is supposed to be used for is finding random Minecraft servers and joining them!
Oh, and **don't use this program for griefing**. Please.
