# Warning
### **This program was made for educational purposes only, and is not meant to be used in malicious ways**. 
Do not DDOS the IPs or do *anything* malicious with the IPs. The only thing this program is supposed to be used for is finding random Minecraft servers and joining them!
Oh, and **don't use this program for griefing**. Please.
